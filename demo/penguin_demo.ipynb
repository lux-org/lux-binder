The dataset consists of data for 344 penguins. The data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/). The data can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data?select=penguins_size.csv).
